//part A of the programming assignment - finding maximal matches







// given two strings, index all the k-long strings( and their locations, and then use the k-long strings in the other to query this index.


// whenever a match is found, we extend it in both directions to the first mismatch and return a tupple indicating positions of this maximal match in both sequences.)
